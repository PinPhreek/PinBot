# PinBot
This is a Twitchbot for LoL - Fans

# Installation
This is a Java-project, so install it as such.

# Use
After compliling and exporting run the .jar file with ```java -jar <YOUR-JAR-FILE>```.
This will create a config file for you. If you get an error create a folder ```config``` in the directory the .jar - file is in.
After that run the jar again.

Look into the ```config``` folder. There sould be a config.txt - file.

On **Windows** you should doubleclick this file or open it with Notepad. 
On **Linux** you can also doubleclick or use nano or vi(m).

You will see at the bottom some lines that need to be filed up. Go to twitch.tv and create a new account. And get an OAth-token.
Fill in ```ACCOUNT=<YOUR-BOT-ACCOUNT-NAME>; OAUTH=<YOUR-OAUTH-TOKEN>; CHANNEL=<CHANNEL-IT-SHOULD-CONNECT-TO>```

Run the .jar file again and look if the channel it should connect to has a ```Heelo Chat!``` in the chat. Alternatively you can,
after running the .jar - file, go to the desired chat and enter !test. If you get a response from your bot - account the bot works.
